# rust-playground

## Installation?
Okay.

Firstly I trully recommend you use NixOS instead of other OS.

If you done on previous step you should `git-clone` this repo (I hope you know how to do that).

Go to repo and run nix-shell:
```shell
nix-shell shell.nix
```

Go to project directory and run cargo:
```shell
cd project
```
```shell
cargo run
```
